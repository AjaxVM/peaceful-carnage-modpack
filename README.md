# peaceful-carnage-modpack
A Minecraft modpack specifically tweaked to be semi-peaceful on the surface, and then very challenging everywhere else.

Features multiple dimensions, tech, magic, farming, ranching.

Basically, this pack builds around a few core mods (Tinkers Construct, HarvestCraft, Immersive Engineering), adds a bunch of support, a few world gen/dungeons, and dimensions of horror.
