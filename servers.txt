Steps:

Create directory to host server instance.

Download/install server forge (version 1.12.2-14.23.1.2583).

Your directory should look like:
	./
	libraries/
	mods/
	forge-1.12.2-14.23.1.2583-universal.jar
	minecraft_server.1.12.2

Copy the config directory from repo to your directory.

After running the modpack client at least once, copy the mods directory from the client to the server.

Remove any client-side config/mods listed in `client-side-mods.txt`

Copy `start_server.bat` script to your directory to start the server on Windows (or use similar Java settings in other environments as are in the script).

Make sure you accept the generated eula.txt
